                <p class="abstract">
                    Many decisions rest on the collective judgment of small groups like committees, boards, or teams.
                    However, some group members may have hidden agendas and manipulate this judgment to sway decisions
                    in their favor. Utilizing an incentivized experiment, I compare how the
                    Delphi technique and face-to-face interaction are affected by manipulation.
                    <br>
                    Without manipulation, Delphi is more accurate than face-to-face interaction. This reverses with
                    manipulation. Perceived trustworthiness only matches objective accuracy in situations with hidden
                    agendas, where face-to-face interaction produces simultaneously more accurate and trusted judgments.
                    With manipulation sharing of (truthful) information decreases in Delphi but not in face-to-face
                    interaction.

                    Debt aversion can have severe adverse effects on financial decision-making. We propose a model of
                    debt aversion, and design an experiment involving real debt and saving contracts, to elicit and
                    jointly estimate debt aversion with preferences over time, risk and losses. Structural estimations
                    reveal that the vast majority of participants (89%) are debt averse, and that this has a strong
                    impact on choice. We estimate the "borrowing premium" -- the compensation a debt averse person
                    would require to accept getting into debt -- to be around 16% of the principal for our average
                    participant.

                    <p class="abstract">
                        We develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring
                        individual debt aversion. To this end, we first estimate debt aversion on an individual level,
                        using choice data from <span class="link"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07538.pdf"

                        </span>
                        This data also contains responses to a large set of debt aversion survey items, consisting of
                        existing items from the literature and novel items developed for this study. Out of these, we
                        identify a survey module comprising two qualitative survey items to best predict debt aversion
                        in the incentivized experiment.
