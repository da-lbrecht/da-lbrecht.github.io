                <p class="abstract">
                    Debt aversion can have severe adverse effects on financial decision-making. We propose a model of
                    debt aversion, and design an experiment involving real debt and saving contracts, to elicit and
                    jointly estimate debt aversion with preferences over time, risk and losses. Structural estimations
                    reveal that the vast majority of participants (89%) are debt averse, and that this has a strong
                    impact on choice. We estimate the “debt-premium” – the compensation a debt averse person would
                    require to accept getting into debt – to be around 16% of the principal for our average participant.

                <p class="abstract">
                    This study investigates how different interaction formats and threat of manipulation influence
                    accuracy and trustworthiness of quantitative, human judgments generated in small groups.
                    Many institutional decisions are taken based on the aggregated judgment of teams,
                    task forces or the like who evaluate some objective criterion. Ideally, such aggregated judgment
                    should be objectively accurate and trusted by decision makers, in order to correctly inform
                    consequential decisions.
                    Both, accuracy and trustworthiness, may though well be in question, if group members have personal
                    stakes in the decisions. Issues aggravate if these stakes are non-transparent, i.e., group members
                    have a hidden agenda. A way to extract collective intelligence from groups in hidden agenda settings
                    that is simultaneously accurate and trusted is yet unidentified. As a consequence, many ill-informed
                    and thus poor decisions with high societal stakes might be taken.  As such, I propose an
                    experimental investigation on group interaction to empirically identify behavioral mechanisms that,
                    solve, or at least mitigate the negative effects of hidden agendas on accuracy and trust.

                <p>The Debt Aversion Survey Module<br>
                    <span class="coauthors">(with Thomas Meissner)</span>

                    <p class="abstract">
                        We develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring
                        individual debt aversion. To this end, we first estimate debt aversion on an individual level,
                        using data from
                        <span class="link"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07538.pdf"
                           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meissner and Albrecht (2022),</a>
                        </span>
                        which also contained responses to a large set of debt aversion survey items, consisting of
                        existing survey items from the literature and novel items developed for this study. Out of
                        these, we then select a total of three qualitative survey items as our survey module, that
                        jointly best predict debt aversion in the incentivized experiment.

                <p>Debt aversion among German households - Evidence from the SOEP<br>
                    <span class="coauthors">(with Ciril Bosch-Rosa and Thomas Meissner)</span>

                    <p class="abstract">
                        We measure individual debt aversion through a survey module among participants of the 2020
                        representative innovation sample of the German socio-economic panel (SOEP). Exploiting the panel
                        nature of the data we investigate on the relation of individual debt attitudes and real-world
                        indebtedness as well as other debt-related behaviors such as homeownership.
