                    Debt aversion can have severe adverse effects on financial decision-making. We propose a model of
                    debt aversion, and design an experiment involving real debt and saving contracts, to elicit and
                    jointly estimate debt aversion with preferences over time, risk and losses. Structural estimations
                    reveal that the vast majority of participants (89\%) are debt averse, and that this has a strong
                    impact on choice. We estimate the ``borrowing premium'' -- the compensation a debt averse person
                    would require to accept getting into debt -- to be around 16\% of the principal for our average
                    participant.

                    <p class="abstract">
                        We develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring
                        individual debt aversion. To this end, we first estimate debt aversion on an individual level,
                        using choice data from

                        This data also contains responses to a large set of debt aversion survey items, consisting of
                        existing items from the literature and novel items developed for this study. Out of these, we
                        identify a survey module comprising two qualitative survey items to best predict debt aversion
                        in the incentivized experiment.

                <p>Hidden Agendas in Small Group Judgment Aggregation<br>
                    <span class="link"><a href="https://osf.io/cv4md/"

                <p class="abstract">
                    Many institutional decisions are taken based on the aggregate judgment of small groups, such as
                    teams, expert committees or the like. However, some group members may have a hidden agenda, and
                    manipulate this judgment to induce a consequent decision in their own interest.
                    <br>
                    By means of an experiment, I test how manipulation affects the accuracy and trustworthiness of such
                    judgment if based on the Delphi technique as opposed to unstructured face-to-face interaction.
                    Further, through structural estimations, I identify channels of robustness by decomposing accuracy
                    differences into bias, information and noise.
                    <br>
                    Without manipulation, structured Delphi interaction produces more accurate judgments than
                    unstructured face-to-face interaction. This result reverses with manipulation, which does hamper
                    accuracy in Delphi groups but - somewhat surprisingly - not in face-to-face groups. Robustness
                    towards bias is most important to maintain accuracy.
