                    Debt aversion can have severe adverse effects on financial decision-making. We propose a model of
                    debt aversion, and design an experiment involving real debt and saving contracts, to elicit and
                    jointly estimate debt aversion with preferences over time, risk and losses. Structural estimations
                    reveal that the vast majority of participants (89%) are debt averse, and that this has a strong
                    impact on choice. We estimate the "borrowing premium" -- the compensation a debt averse person
                    would require to accept getting into debt -- to be around 16% of the principal for our average
                    participant.

                    <p class="abstract">
                        We develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring
                        individual debt aversion. To this end, we first estimate debt aversion on an individual level,
                        using choice data from

                        This data also contains responses to a large set of debt aversion survey items, consisting of
                        existing items from the literature and novel items developed for this study. Out of these, we
                        identify a survey module comprising two qualitative survey items to best predict debt aversion
                        in the incentivized experiment.

                <p>Hidden Agendas in Small Group Judgment Aggregation<br>

                <p class="abstract">
                    Many decisions rest on the collective judgment of small groups like committees, boards, or teams.
                    However, some group members may have hidden agendas, and manipulate this judgment to induce a
                    consequent decision in their interest.
                    <br>
                    Utilizing an incentivized experiment, I analyze how manipulation affects the accuracy and
                    trustworthiness of such group judgment. To this end, I compare group judgments from
                    the scientifically endorsed, structured Delphi interaction as opposed to unstructured face-
                    to-face interaction, which is ubiquitous in real-world institutions. Furthermore, I identify
                    mechanisms of
                    robustness, by decomposing accuracy differences across both techniques into bias, noise, and
                    utilization of valuable information through structural estimations in the BIN-modelling framework
                    (Satopää et al., 2021).
                    <br>
                    Without manipulation, Delphi is more accurate than face-to-face interaction, and indistinguishable
                    from the Bayesian benchmark. Manipulation decreases accuracy for Delphi, but not for face-to-face
                    interaction. As a consequence, with manipulation Delphi is less accurate than face-to-face
                    interaction and even worse than a naïve benchmark. Trustworthiness does not always match accuracy.
                    Judgments from face-to-face interaction - unjustifiably - enjoy higher levels of trust without
                    hidden agendas. Trustworthiness correctly decreases with hidden agendas for Delphi groups, but
                    - unjustifiably - also for face-to-face groups. With hidden agendas, face-to-face groups are
                    simultaneously more accurate and trusted. Manipulation likely decreases accuracy through more bias
                    and less utilization of valuable information.

                        We measure individual debt aversion among participants of the 2020
