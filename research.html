                <p class="abstract">
                    Many decisions rest on the collective judgment of small groups like committees or teams. However,
                    some group members may have hidden agendas and manipulate this judgment to influence decisions in
                    their favor. Utilizing an incentivized experiment, I compare how objective accuracy and perceived
                    trustworthiness of judgments from groups using two out-of-the-shelf interaction formats - the Delphi technique and face-to-face meetings -
                    are affected by manipulation.
                    <br>
                    Without manipulation, Delphi is more accurate. With manipulation, face-to-face is more accurate.
                    Only in situations with manipulation the more accurate interaction format is perceived as more
                    trustworthy. With manipulation, sharing of (truthful) information decreases in Delphi but not in
                    face-to-face interaction.

                    Debt aversion can have severe adverse effects on financial decision-making. We propose a model of
                    debt aversion, and design an experiment involving real debt and saving contracts, to elicit and
                    jointly estimate debt aversion with preferences over time, risk and losses. Structural estimations
                    reveal that the vast majority of participants (89%) are debt averse, and that this has a strong
                    impact on choice. We estimate the "borrowing premium" -- the compensation a debt averse person
                    would require to accept getting into debt -- to be around 16% of the principal for our average
                    participant.

                    We develop an experimentally validated, short and easy-to-use survey module for measuring

                        identify a survey module comprising two qualitative survey items to best predict debt aversion

                    We collect pre-analysis plans and analysis code from 100+ research teams testing hypotheses about the impact
                    of having daughters on attitudes, preferences, and behaviors using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel.
                    The main aim of this study is twofold. First, by varying whether research teams have access to a 5% sample of
                    the data before writing their pre-analysis plan, we explore whether initial access to sample data improves the
                    quality of the pre-analysis plan and analysis compared to writing a pre-analysis plan without access to any data.
                    Second, the study aims to further our understanding of the impact of having daughters on behaviors and
                    preferences by conducting a meta-analysis of the test results suggested by participating research teams.

                    This initiative examined systematically the extent to which a large set of
                    archival research findings generalizes across contexts. We repeated the 
                    key analyses for 29 original strategic management effects in the same 
                    context (direct reproduction) as well as in 52 novel time periods and
                    geographies; 45% of the reproductions returned results matching the
                    original reports together with 55% of tests in different spans of 
                    years and 40% of tests in novel geographies. Some original findings
                    were associated with multiple new tests. Reproducibility was the best
                    predictor of generalizability—for the findings that proved directly
                    reproducible, 84% emerged in other available time periods and 57%
                    emerged in other geographies. Overall, only limited empirical 
                    evidence emerged for context sensitivity. In a forecasting survey,
                    independent scientists were able to anticipate which effects would
                    find support in tests in new samples.
