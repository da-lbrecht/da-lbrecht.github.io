                    Many decisions rest on the collective judgment of small groups like committees or teams. However,
                    some group members may have hidden agendas and manipulate this judgment to influence decisions in
                    their favor. Utilizing an incentivized experiment, I compare how objective accuracy and perceived
                    trustworthiness of judgments from groups using two out-of-the-shelf interaction formats - the Delphi technique and face-to-face meetings -
                    are affected by manipulation.
                    <br>
                    Without manipulation, Delphi is more accurate. With manipulation, face-to-face is more accurate.
                    Only in situations with manipulation the more accurate interaction format is perceived as more
                    trustworthy. With manipulation, sharing of (truthful) information decreases in Delphi but not in
                    face-to-face interaction.

                    Debt aversion can adversely impact financial decision-making. We propose a model
                    of debt aversion and conduct an experiment involving real debt and saving contracts to
                    jointly elicit debt aversion with preferences over time, risk, and intertemporal losses. We
                    find that 89% of participants are debt averse, which strongly influences their choices.
                    We estimate the “borrowing premium” – the compensation an average person would require
                    to accept getting into debt – to be around 16% of the principal. Building on these
                    findings, we validate a survey module to measure debt aversion in real-world contexts
                    where complex laboratory experiments are infeasible. Applying the survey module to a
                    large, representative sample of German households, we find that debt aversion is both statistically
                    and economically significantly associated with actual debt-taking and financial
                    health.

                    We collect pre-analysis plans and analysis code from 100+ research teams testing hypotheses about the impact
                    of having daughters on attitudes, preferences, and behaviors using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel.
                    The main aim of this study is twofold. First, by varying whether research teams have access to a 5% sample of
                    the data before writing their pre-analysis plan, we explore whether initial access to sample data improves the
                    quality of the pre-analysis plan and analysis compared to writing a pre-analysis plan without access to any data.
                    Second, the study aims to further our understanding of the impact of having daughters on behaviors and
                    preferences by conducting a meta-analysis of the test results suggested by participating research teams.

                <p class="abstract">
                    Generosity in economic games is typically attributed to social preferences such as altruism, fairness, inequality
                    aversion, and reciprocity. However, the seminal moral wiggle room paper argues that much of what appears to be
                    generosity is driven less by genuine social preferences than by concerns about self-image and social image.
                    In this large-scale (n=12,000 participants) study, we first replicate the moral wiggle room experiment online
                    with a sample almost thirty times larger than the original. Importantly, we then investigate whether the effect
                    diminishes when the moral context is strengthened by using vulnerable groups as recipients. Finally, we test
                    robustness by varying only the self-image motive, both for standard recipients and for vulnerable ones. Overall,
                    our study provides highly powered conceptual replications that shed light on the robustness of the original moral
                    wiggle room effect under different conditions of moral responsibility and motivational drivers.

                    To conduct high-powered meta-analytic tests of the hypotheses (treatment effects) evaluated in the 
                    selected experimental design. (iii) To estimate the population heterogeneity in these treatment effects 
                    across the participating laboratories (Holzmeister et al., 2024). (iv) To examine whether treatment effects 
                    estimated in the many-lab data collection differ from treatment effects estimated in an online data collection. 
                    (v) To compare the student population in the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) with a

                    This initiative examined systematically the extent to which a large set of
                    archival research findings generalizes across contexts. We repeated the 
                    key analyses for 29 original strategic management effects in the same 
                    context (direct reproduction) as well as in 52 novel time periods and
                    geographies; 45% of the reproductions returned results matching the
                    original reports together with 55% of tests in different spans of 
                    years and 40% of tests in novel geographies. Some original findings
                    were associated with multiple new tests. Reproducibility was the best
                    predictor of generalizability—for the findings that proved directly
                    reproducible, 84% emerged in other available time periods and 57%
                    emerged in other geographies. Overall, only limited empirical 
                    evidence emerged for context sensitivity. In a forecasting survey,
                    independent scientists were able to anticipate which effects would
                    find support in tests in new samples.
